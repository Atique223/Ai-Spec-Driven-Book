# Create Physical AI Book Specification

## Prompt Text

```
Create a book on Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics using Docusaurus, Spec-Kit Plus, and Claude Code, following the constitution principles.
```

## Response Text

Created a comprehensive specification for the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics book project. The specification includes:

- User Scenarios & Testing with 3 prioritized user stories (P1-P3) covering content creation, navigation structure, and simulation-first learning
- Functional Requirements (FR-001 through FR-015) aligned with the project constitution principles
- Key Entities including Book Chapters, Course Modules, Simulation Environments, and Physical AI Concepts
- Success Criteria with 7 measurable outcomes (SC-001 through SC-007) that are technology-agnostic

The specification follows the constitution principles of Spec-Driven Development, AI-Assisted Accuracy, Embodied Intelligence Focus, Clarity for Technical Learners, and Reproducibility & Verifiability. It also incorporates the Course Alignment Principles for Physical AI Orientation, Humanoid Robotics Context, and Simulation-First Learning.

A quality checklist was also created to validate the specification completeness.

## Outcome

Successfully created a detailed specification for the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics book that aligns with the project constitution and provides clear direction for implementation.
