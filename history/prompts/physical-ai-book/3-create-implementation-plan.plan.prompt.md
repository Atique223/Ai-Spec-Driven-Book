# Create Implementation Plan for Physical AI Book

## Prompt Text

```
$ARGUMENTS
```

## Response Text

Created a comprehensive implementation plan for the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics book project. The plan includes:

- Updated implementation plan document (plan.md) with technical context, constitution check, and project structure
- Research document (research.md) with technology decisions and rationale
- Data model (data-model.md) defining the content organization structure
- Quickstart guide (quickstart.md) for developers contributing to the book

The implementation plan aligns with all constitution principles including Spec-Driven Development, AI-Assisted Accuracy, Embodied Intelligence Focus, Clarity for Technical Learners, and Reproducibility & Verifiability. The technical approach uses Docusaurus as the documentation framework with content organized by modules as specified in the constitution.

## Outcome

Successfully created the implementation plan with all required Phase 0 and Phase 1 artifacts for the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics book project.

## Evaluation

- [x] Implementation plan created with all required sections
- [x] Research document completed with technology decisions
- [x] Data model defined for content organization
- [x] Quickstart guide created for development workflow
- [x] All constitution principles addressed in the plan
- [x] Project structure aligned with Docusaurus framework
- [x] Plan satisfies all functional requirements from spec
