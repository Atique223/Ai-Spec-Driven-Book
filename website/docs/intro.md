# Introduction to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to the comprehensive guide on Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics. This book explores the fascinating intersection of artificial intelligence and physical robotic systems, bridging the gap between digital intelligence and real-world applications.

## About This Book

This book is structured around two core modules that provide a comprehensive understanding of how AI systems operate in physical environments:

- **Module 1**: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2) - Understanding the middleware, communication patterns, and control systems that enable AI agents to interact with robotic hardware
- **Module 2**: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity) - Exploring simulation environments that allow safe testing and development of AI-robotic interactions

## Target Audience

This book is designed for undergraduate-level students and professionals with basic programming knowledge (Python/Java/C++) and fundamental AI concepts (machine learning, neural networks). The content balances theoretical understanding with practical applications, making it suitable for junior to senior undergraduate level courses.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this book, readers will be able to:

- Understand how AI connects to physical robotic systems
- Explain the role of ROS 2 in robotic communication and control
- Apply simulation tools like Gazebo and Unity for robotics development
- Design AI systems that interact with physical environments considering real-world constraints like motion, gravity, and sensors
- Implement solutions for humanoid robots operating in both simulated and real environments

## How to Use This Book

Each chapter includes knowledge checks with questions, exercises, and conceptual challenges to help you assess your understanding. We recommend following the modules sequentially, as concepts build upon each other throughout the book.

The code examples in this book are designed to run in cloud-based notebook environments (Jupyter notebooks or similar) to ensure consistent execution across different systems.

Let's begin our journey into the world of Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics!
