# Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

Welcome to Module 1, where we explore the middleware that enables communication between different components of robotic systems. ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2) serves as the "nervous system" of modern robotics, facilitating communication between sensors, actuators, controllers, and AI agents.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Explain the role of ROS 2 as robot middleware
- Understand the concepts of nodes, topics, and services
- Bridge Python AI agents to ROS controllers using rclpy
- Understand URDF for humanoid robot structure

## Module Overview

ROS 2 is not an operating system but rather a flexible framework for writing robot software. It provides hardware abstraction, device drivers, libraries, visualizers, message-passing, package management, and more. In this module, we'll focus on how ROS 2 enables AI systems to interact with physical robotic hardware.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, ensure you have:

- Basic Python programming knowledge
- Understanding of fundamental AI concepts
- Familiarity with basic robotics concepts (sensors, actuators, control systems)

## Module Structure

This module is divided into several key topics:

1. **ROS 2 Middleware**: Understanding the role and architecture of ROS 2
2. **Nodes, Topics, and Services**: The fundamental communication patterns
3. **Python AI Bridging**: Connecting AI agents to ROS controllers
4. **URDF Structure**: Understanding robot description and humanoid robot modeling

Each section includes practical examples and knowledge checks to reinforce your understanding.

## Knowledge Check

Before proceeding, consider: How might a centralized communication system like ROS 2 be essential for coordinating complex humanoid robots with multiple sensors and actuators?
